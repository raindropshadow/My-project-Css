        <p>Malala is born in Mingora, Pakistan, to proud parents Ziauddin and Toor Pekai Yousafzai. Ziauddin names his daughter after Malalai, a Pashtun heroine.
        </p>
        <p> Welcoming a baby girl is not always cause for celebration in Pakistan — but Ziauddin is determined to give Malala every opportunity that a boy would have. Ziauddin, an educator, promises that Malala will go to school and be treated with equality in his home.

    <h4 class="card">January 2007 - January 2009</h4>
        <p>Growing up in Swat Valley, often called the "Switzerland of Asia," Malala shares Ziauddin’s love of learning. She spends her childhood playing outside and exploring new worlds in books.</p>
        <p>In 2007, Taliban militants take control of Swat. They ban many things — like owning a television and playing music — and enforce harsh punishments, including public executions, for citizens who defy their orders. In December of 2008, the Taliban issues an edict banning girls from going to school.</p>
        <p>Using the pen name “Gul Makai” to protect her identity, Malala begins blogging for the BBC about life under the Taliban. She describes how she feels in the final days before her school is set to close.</p>

<div class="block">
        <h4 class="card">May - October 2009</h4>
        <p>The Pakistani army moves in to Swat Valley to force the Taliban out and fighting ensues. More than one million residents of Swat, including the Yousafzai family, flee their homes to other parts of the country.</p>
        <p>After reading Malala’s blog for the BBC, The New York Times features Malala and Ziauddin in a short documentary about their life and fight to protect girls’ education in Swat.</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
    <h4 class="card">November 2011</h4>
    <p>The Pakistani army weakens the Taliban’s stronghold in Swat Valley, forcing them to retreat. While the Taliban no longer control Swat, they remain in rural areas outside Mingora.</p>
    <p>Ziauddin’s school is able to reopen and Malala is excited to return to the classroom. Although she fears retaliation for speaking out against the Taliban, she publicly campaigns for girls to go to school — and wins Pakistan’s first National Youth Peace Prize.</p>
</div>

    <h4 class="card">October 9, 2012</h4>
    <p>Due to her increased prominence, both in Pakistan and around the world, the Taliban target Malala. A masked gunman boards Malala’s school bus and asks for her by name. He shoots Malala in the head, neck and shoulder. Two of her friends, Kainat and Shazia, are also injured in the attack.</p>
    <p>Malala survives, but remains in critical condition as she is transported to the United Kingdom for treatment. People in Pakistan and around the world pray for her recovery.</p>

        <h4 class="card">January 2013</h4>

<div class="block">
        <h4 class="card">July 12, 2013</h4>
        <p>In her first public appearance since the attack, Malala speaks at the United Nations on her 16th birthday. The U.N. declares July 12th “Malala Day” — and Malala promises to dedicate this day each year to shining a spotlight on the world’s most vulnerable girls.</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
        <h4 class="card">December 2014</h4>
        <p>Malala and Indian activist Kailash Satyarthi win the Nobel Peace Prize. Malala invites girls from Syria, Nigeria and Pakistan to attend the ceremony in Oslo, as she becomes the youngest-ever Nobel Laureate.</p>

        <h4 class="card">September 7, 2016</h4>
        <p>On her last “first day” of secondary school, Malala launches a campaign encouraging people around the world to support education for <a href="https://blog.malala.org/women-and-girls-from-around-the-world-are-sharing-yesallgirls-photos-heres-how-and-why-you-a97f8efc9fe0" >#YesAllGirls.</a> </p>

        <h4 class="card">October 2017- Present</h4>
        <p>Malala is currently enrolled at the University of Oxford, where she is studying philosophy, politics and economics at Lady Margaret Hall. She balances her school work and social life with leading the fight for girls’ education around the world — but she is not fighting alone.</p>
